# travel-map-locations

The travel map allows users to input locations and notes to store an electronic copy of the world they understand and aspire to learn more regarding.  By selecting locations on the map, a user can create a custom collection of locations.   Each location has the ability to contain notes.  The notes can be personalized as a scrap book to reminisce or as a folder of dreams.  
 
# Travel Map of Locations

## Background:




## Use Case:



## Initial UX:


## Functionality:
- display a map
- store a cookie for the returning and new users
- allow the user to create locations by selecting a spot on the map
- allow the user to update the location to contain notes
- allow the user to delete a previously placed location on the map



## Working Prototype:


## Technical:
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Bootstrap.css
- JQuery
- Google Maps


## Lessons Learned:
- Version control:
Using version control across multiple branches proved to be a roadblock for my completion of this project.  Yet, this project forced me to learn more about the utilization, breath and foundation of Git.  While reaching out for resources and assistance, I have a new appreciation for Git, version control and dev ops.  While I may be stumbling on the basics of controlling versions, I believe that a strong foundation can be built into a strength.  I look forward to learning more about dev ops, including Git utlization.  
- Google Maps:
Google has great documentation and support for their APIs.  I built upon my previous knowledge of Google Maps, and elaborated on control of the views.  
- Server side development:
- Testing:
- Dev Ops:
- JQuery Fallbacks:
JQuery, although a tool which is taught heavily and relied upon often, it seems that more and more discussions have a negative opinion of JQuery.  I see the benefit of interacting with the DOM, yet during the execution of this project, I found myself saying, 'There has got to be a better way'.  I look forward to learning more about 

## Development Roadmap:

## Vision:
- allow the user to search for a location and create a location
- custom marker images for category of past, present or future
