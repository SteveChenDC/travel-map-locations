# travel-map-locations

The travel map allows users to input locations and notes to store an electronic copy of the world they understand and aspire to learn more regarding.  By selecting locations on the map, a user can create a custom collection of locations.   Each location has the ability to contain notes.  The notes can be personalized as a scrap book to reminisce or as a folder of dreams.
